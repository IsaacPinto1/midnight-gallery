            artwork from mostly unknown artists. Our name comes from the
            idea of 'moonlighting', or having a second job in addition to one's main
            form of employment. Everyone featured in the Midnight Gallery 'moonlights' 
            as an artist and our gallery represents a space for these non-professional
            artists to display their work. Our hope is to bring a meaningful level of
            exposure to artists that wouldn't normally get the chance to display their 
            work in a gallery setting. We hope you enjoy their work.</div>
